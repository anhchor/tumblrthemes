meta notes

what's different?

i know how to use flexbox and grid now
css variables


editing in the theme editor still sucks
slow to load (each takes 5+ seconds)
npf fucks up and doesnt preview, have to check actual blog
notes don't show up


seeing old stuff like 'why did i do this? this is stupid' and then fixing it
and then seeing that i did it for a reason (to get around stupid tumblr markup limitations)

e.g. photourl exists for 500w but not 700w
