Here's the extended, very detailed version that goes through every step (from getting the code, to setting up how to edit it, to saving it and publishing it on Tumblr). If you get stuck or there's a part that's confusing, please [drop me a message]()!




To learn more deeply about HTML and CSS, I recommend reading the W3Schools website, which has many examples that you can play around with yourself.

## the bare basics

**What are HTML and CSS?**

HTML and CSS are two of the main languages that make up websites.

- You use HTML to put _what_ you want to go on your website. For example: your images, text, and links.
- You use CSS to change how your website _looks_. For example: what colours you use, the size of your text, if your page has two columns, and so on.


**How do you edit HTML?**

HTML is distinguishable by its angle brackets `<` and `>`. For example:

```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

The `<p>` is a **paragraph** tag. It tells the browser that the text between the **opening tag** `<p>` and the **closing tag** `</p>` is a paragraph.

You can use tags inside each other. This is called **nesting tags**. For example:

```
<p>This is a paragraph with some <strong>bold text</strong>.</p>
```



**How do you edit CSS?**

CSS uses the curly braces `{` and `}`. For example:

```
p {
    font-size: 20px;
}
```

This means that a paragraph will have a text size of **20 pixels**.

Each line between the curly braces ends in a **semicolon** `;`. Adding more lines will follow the same format:

```
p {
    font-size: 20px;
    color: red;
}
```
This paragraph will also be in **red text**.


Note: the spacing here isn't required. You could also write this as:

```
p { font-size:20px; color:red; }
```

This would work exactly the same way. However, the spaced out version is easier to read and catch mistakes on. It's how most people format their CSS.
